Update -2-20-19 – we talking bout gists here…so the gist of nihilism to me is that stuff has less inherent meaning than we think. I am this. Nah… you really aren’t you just have cultivated a certain set of habits that you could change. Views that can change. Is there an inherent meaning to anything? Not really even sure we need to explore this concept, but if we look at nihilism as the total rejection of meaning in anything we can see that this sort of concept is kind of dumb. Like words have meaning bro. A priori type logic is real bro. What can we gain from thinking of words as signals to things that exist in some approximate form? Authenticity…warm glowy feelings from grasping onto something solid? So yeah that part 1. Part 2 gists – like maybe it’s the concept that we can get the gist of all things…maybe it’s the opposite of nihilism that there is a reason for why everything happens that is perfectly explainable because the reasons are based on things with meaning.
